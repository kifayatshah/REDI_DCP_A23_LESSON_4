Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own ..."

They are only the raw material four our reasoned choice, which finds its own good or evil in working with them. How will it find the good? Not by marveling at the material! For if judgments about the material are straight that makes our choices good, but if those judgments are twisted, our choices turn bad."
